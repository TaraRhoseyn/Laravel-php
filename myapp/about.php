    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Sweet Delights Bakery began in 2003 when Master Baker Maria Rodriguez turned her passion for baking into a family business. What started as a small counter serving fresh bread has grown into a beloved local institution.</p>

    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>We believe in creating baked goods the old-fashioned way - with quality ingredients, time-tested techniques, and absolutely no preservatives. Every morning, our bakers arrive before dawn to ensure our shelves are stocked with fresh, warm treats for our community.</p>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>Our dedicated team of bakers and staff members work tirelessly to maintain the high standards that our customers have come to expect. Many of our employees have been with us for over a decade, bringing expertise and dedication to every creation.</p>

    <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
    <p>Sweet Delights is proud to support local schools and charities. We regularly donate bread to local food banks and participate in community events. Our bakery isn't just a business - it's a part of the neighborhood.</p>
